[00:33.59] Life is a waterfall
[00:36.31] We're one in the river
[00:38.01] And one again after the fall
[00:52.01] 
[00:45.22] Swimming through the void
[00:47.02] We hear the word
[00:48.30] We lose ourselves
[00:50.09] But we find it all
[00:59.09] 
[00:57.46] 'Cause we are the ones that want to play
[01:00.86] Always want to go
[01:02.04] But you never want to stay
[01:15.04] 
[01:09.61] And we are the ones that want to choose
[01:12.48] Always want to play
[01:14.22] But you never want to lose
[01:27.22] 
[01:27.92] Aerials, in the sky
[01:33.84] When you lose small mind
[01:37.14] You free your life
[01:46.14] 
[01:40.21] Life is a waterfall
[01:43.05] We drink from the river
[01:44.38] Then we turn around and put up our walls
[02:04.38] 
[01:52.03] Swimming through the void
[01:53.26] We hear the word
[01:55.05] We lose ourselves
[01:56.29] But we find it all
[02:05.29] 
[02:03.72] 'Cause we are the ones that want to play
[02:07.36] Always want to go
[02:08.47] But you never want to stay
[02:21.47] 
[02:15.96] And we are the ones that want to choose
[02:19.56] Always want to play
[02:20.61] But you never want to lose
[02:25.27] Ohhh
[02:27.27] 
[02:39.94] Aerials, in the sky
[02:45.60] When you lose small mind
[02:47.97] You free your life
[02:51.65] Aerials, so up high
[02:57.32] When you free your eyes
[03:00.00] Eternal prize
[03:03.45] Aerials, in the sky
[03:08.41] When you lose small mind
[03:11.77] You free your life
[03:14.81] Aerials, so up high
[03:20.36] When you free your eyes
[03:23.28] Eternal prize

```lrc
[00:34.03] Life is a waterfall
[00:36.77] We're one in the river and one again after the fall
[01:02.27] 
[00:45.76] Swimming through the void, we hear the word
[00:49.06] We lose ourselves, but we find it all
[01:07.56] 
[00:57.81] 'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
[01:01.14] Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
[01:21.64] 
[01:09.93] And we are the ones that wanna choose
[01:13.27] Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose
[01:34.77] 
[01:28.21] Aerials in the sky
[01:34.25] When you lose small mind, you free your life
[01:40.28] Life is a waterfall
[01:43.23] We drink from the river, then we turn around and put up our walls
[02:15.73] 
[01:52.09] Swimming through the void, we hear the word
[01:55.45] We lose ourselves, but we find it all
[02:13.95] 
[02:04.06] 'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
[02:07.31] Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
[02:27.81] 
[02:16.19] And we are the ones that wanna choose
[02:19.48] Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose, oh
[02:42.98] 
[02:39.79] Aerials in the sky
[02:45.51] When you lose small mind, you free your life
[02:51.40] Aerials, so up high
[02:57.12] When you free your eyes, eternal prize
[03:03.29] Aerials in the sky
[03:08.96] When you lose small mind, you free your life
[03:14.82] Aerials, so up high
[03:20.73] When you free your eyes, eternal prize
